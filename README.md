# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project is a part of udacity nanodegree program. In this project, We will train and deploy a model on Azure cloud using AutoML feature of cloud. We will deploye it as a service and test its endpoint using python SDK. Further we can use this endpoint to any external API. We also create and publish ML pipeline, which automate the above process. At the end we will consume the pipeline endpoints. We have used bank marketing data as an example ml problem

## Architectural Diagram

In this project, We are going to create and publish ML pipeline. We have used bank marketing data as an example ml problem. Following is the step by step architetural diagram. [1]:

Step 1 Authentication: This step is required to authorize and authenticate users as well as developer of azure ML services.

Step 2 Auto ML Model: This is used to do feature engineering, model sampling and to select the best model (end-to-end ML process) automatically.

Step 3 Best Model Deployment: In this step we deploy the best model suitable for given data that we got from AutoML.

Step 4 Logging enable: Here we use azureâ€™s Application Insight service to enable logging.


Step 5 Swagger Documentation: Swagger is a external tool. We use it here to understand the model endpoint.

Step 6 Model endpoint consumption: After deployment model creates endpoints. We can test or use the model using this endpoints.

Step 7 Creation and publishing of pipeline: We can Automate the above workflow by creating a azure pipeline and publish it.

Step 8: Documentation: It is required to understand the model architecture and its usage.  




## Key Steps

**AutoML Experiment**
1. Upload the dataset to perform ML task

**Deploy Model and enable application insight**
1. Deployed model initial status (Application insight is not enabled)

## Future Improvement suggestions:
There is lot more we can do and add in this project. We can integrate mobile cameras or speech recorders as IOT devices then use a machine learning problem such as object detection or language detection. For this kind of problems we can use/add services such as azure stream analytics and azure function. Creating and publishing pipeline which can incorporate this many services would be great fun. Again shouldn't ignore cost.

If we talk about this particular problem, we can create a webpage and consume pipeline endpoints. As we use this service we are going to generate more data and need to retrain and redeploy the model again. So, we can add a feature to our pipeline which can trigger this retraining and redeployment automatically.
