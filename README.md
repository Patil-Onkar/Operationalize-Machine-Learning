# Operationalizing Machine Learning

This project is a part of udacity nanodegree program. In this project, We used AutoML and deployed best suitable model.Also, we are going to create and publish ML pipeline. We have used bank marketing data as an example ml problem

## Architectural Diagram

In this project, We are going to create and publish ML pipeline. We have used bank marketing data as an example ml problem. Following is the step by step architetural diagram.:

Step 1 Authentication: This step is required to authorize and authenticate users as well as developer of azure ML services.

Step 2 Auto ML Model: This is used to do feature engineering, model sampling and to select the best model (end-to-end ML process) automatically.

Step 3 Best Model Deployment: In this step we deploy the best model suitable for given data that we got from AutoML.

Step 4 Logging enable: Here we use azureâ€™s Application Insight service to enable logging.


Step 5 Swagger Documentation: Swagger is a external tool. We use it here to understand the model endpoint.

Step 6 Model endpoint consumption: After deployment model creates endpoints. We can test or use the model using this endpoints.

Step 7 Creation and publishing of pipeline: We can Automate the above workflow by creating a azure pipeline and publish it.

Step 8: Documentation: It is required to understand the model architecture and its usage.  




## Key Steps

**AutoML Experiment**
1. Upload the dataset to perform ML task

**Deploy Model and enable application insight**
1. Deployed model initial status (Application insight is not enabled)

**Consume Model Endpoint**

1. Deployed model is consumed/used using python script endpoint.py. Screenshot shows its output

**Create,publish and consume a pipeline**

1. Pipeline section of Azure Machine learning studio. screenshot shows pipeline has been created:
